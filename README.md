# E- commerce website 
Welcome to our React.js powered E-Commerce website! Our goal is to provide users with a user-friendly online shopping experience that incorporates a variety of convenient features. 

Through the implementation of React Router, we've ensured smooth navigation between essential sections like the shop and the cart. The Context API plays a key role by managing the global state, allowing seamless data sharing across components.

In our effort to enhance user convenience, we've integrated a search bar that enables users to easily explore our product range. This intuitive feature simplifies product discovery. We've also introduced a dynamic system that lets users adjust the quantity of items they intend to purchase. The real-time update of the total bill ensures transparency and helps users make informed decisions.

By relying on the Context API, we're able to maintain consistency in the user experience. Changes made in the shopping cart are immediately reflected throughout the website. Our use of React Router ensures a seamless transition from one section to another, enhancing user engagement.
To simplify the checkout process, we've implemented a modal that appears upon clicking the checkout button. This modal prompts users to provide necessary details, streamlining the payment process. 
We're excited to present an E-Commerce platform that combines technology and user-centred design to create a pleasant and hassle-free shopping journey.










# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
